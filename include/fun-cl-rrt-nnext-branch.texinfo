@deffn {Function} {nnext-branch} tree
Destructively modifies and return an @code{rrt-tree}.  If the
`tree' has a finish node, it finds a path from the root to
the end and then replace the root with the next node in that path.
Otherwise it choose one child of the root at random and replace the
root with it. In both cases the new root is orphanized.
