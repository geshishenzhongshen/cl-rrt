* CL-RRT - Common Lisp implementation of RRT (Rapidily exploring Random Tree)

RRT is a fast probabilistic multidimentional path-plannning algorithm
introduced by S.M.LaValle [fn:paper]. It now has a widespread use in robotics
and now able to handle the real time systems such as automatic car
driving AI. Also, it has various extentions and optimization methods
such as:

+ MP-RRT
+ RR-belief-tree
+ RRG
+ RRT*
+ St-RRT

planning. /The International Journal of Robotics Research/, Vol. 20,
No. 5, pp. 378â€“400, 2001.

** Dependencies

This library is at least tested on implementation listed below:

+ SBCL 1.1.2 on X86-64 Linux  3.2.0-39-generic (author's environment)

Also, it depends on the following libraries:

+ ITERATE  ::
    Jonathan Amsterdam's iterator/gatherer/accumulator facility

+ ALEXANDRIA  ::
    Alexandria is a collection of portable public domain utilities.

+ CL-ANNOT by Tomohiro Matsuyama ::
    Python-like Annotation Syntax for Common Lisp

+ ANAPHORA  ::
    
** Installation

+ First grab the code with =git clone git@github.com:guicho271828/cl-rrt.git=
+ Put it in local-project folder
+ open slime REPL
+ =(ql:quickload :cl-rrt)= and the library will be installed along with all
  the dependencies
